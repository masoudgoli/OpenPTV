/*
P-Funktion
car stopped -> press gas pedal
large error, accelerates
too much gas : gain too high

D-Function
control position (to next traffic light)
far away, error is big,
driving, overshoot, back up

PD: rate of change and magnitude
derivative is smaller

I: same speed behind car: we have a steady state error.
I tries to close up

proportional trys to get you as fast as possible 
derivative trys to restrain you to move to quickly
